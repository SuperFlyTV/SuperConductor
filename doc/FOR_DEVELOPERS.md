# For developers

## Prerequisites

SuperConductor has some native dependencies which need to be (re)built from source. This requires a full Node.js native module compiler toolchain, including Python 3.

**On Windows**, modern versions of the Node.js installer come with all the necessary build tools, and no further action is required. If you have issues with Python, install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

**On Linux**, install the `build-essential` package and then install Python 3. Also do a `sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev libudev-dev`

**On macOS**, install XCode and its optional tools `xcode-select --install` and then install Python 3.

## Quick start

- [Install Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
- `cd >>path-to-this-folder<<`
- `yarn`
- `yarn start` (Builds the project and starts the SuperConductor)

## Architecture Overview

The project consists of 3 applications:

- React application (application UI)
- Electron backend (hosts frontend and implements logic)
- TSR Bridge (node app that exposes HTTP server and executes TSR)

Instructions for running each app are in their respective folder.

## Installing Dependencies

This project is a Lerna monorepo, which means that installing dependencies is handled a little differently. To properly bootstrap this project, install all dependencies, and cross-link the various packages, execute the following commands in the root of the project:

```bash
# Installs all dependencies, including Lerna.
yarn

```

## Building the project

```bash
# Compile Typescript, run Webpack, etc:
yarn build

# Make binaries for the SuperConductor UI and tsr-bridge. Must have run "yarn build" first.
# The SuperConductor UI binary will be located at apps/app/dist.
# The tsr-bridge binary will be located at apps/tsr-bridge/dist.
# This command should work on all platforms (Windows, macOS, and Linux).
yarn build:binary
```

## Making a new release (Admins only)

1. Run `yarn release:bump` in the root of the repo to bump the appropriate version numbers in the various `package.json` files. Lerna will automatically commit and push the changes along with the appropriate tag.
2. Wait for the [`Create GitHub Release`](https://github.com/SuperFlyTV/SuperConductor/actions/workflows/create-release.yaml) action to finish.
3. Go to the [releases](https://github.com/SuperFlyTV/SuperConductor/releases) page and publish the draft release.

### Pre-releases

- On the `develop` branch, run `yarn release:preminor` first time after a release: `1.5.4` -> `1.6.0-alpha.0`
  - Then run `yarn release:prerelease` to bump the prerelease version: `1.6.0-alpha.0` -> `1.6.0-alpha.1`
- On `master` branch, if a bugfix needs to be tested, run `yarn release:prerelease`: `1.5.4` -> `1.5.5-alpha.0`
